# How To Deploy a Complete NGINX, PHP, MONGODB/MYSQL and PHPMYADMIN on your OS.

## Introduction - What is Docker ?

Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac or Windows environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper.

Docker Desktop works with your choice of development tools and languages and gives you access to a vast library of certified images and templates in Docker Hub. This enables development teams to extend their environment to rapidly auto-build, continuously integrate, and collaborate using a secure repository.

Some of the key features of Docker Desktop include:

* Ability to containerize and share any application on any cloud platform, in multiple languages and frameworks
* Easy installation and setup of a complete Docker development environment
* Includes the latest version of Kubernetes
* Automatic updates to keep you up to date and secure
* On Windows, the ability to toggle between Linux and Windows Server environments to build applications
* Fast and reliable performance with native Windows Hyper-V virtualization
* Ability to work natively on Linux through WSL 2 on Windows machines
* Volume mounting for code and data, including file change notifications and easy access to running containers on the localhost network
* In-container development and debugging with supported IDEs

## Docker Dashboard

Docker Dashboard gives you a quick view of the containers running on your machine. The Docker Dashboard is available for Mac and Windows. It gives you quick access to container logs, lets you get a shell inside the container, and lets you easily manage container lifecycle (stop, remove, etc.).

To access the dashboard, follow the instructions in the [Docker Desktop Manual](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/dashboard/ "Docker Desktop Manual"). If you open the dashboard now, you will see this tutorial running! The container name `(jolly_bouman)` below is a randomly created name. So, youâ€™ll most likely have a different name.
